# Code-Screen
The Fibonacci web service for Virtustream 
Chris Boscarino 08.2017

v1.0 - Initial Release

REQUIREMENTS:  
          1. A webserver with the ability to run php
          2. A machine with the ability to run bash
          3. Edits to the fibonacci.php to reflect the command required to execute fib.sh

The Fibonacci web service for Virtustream is made up of two elements:

fib.sh
fibonacci.php


1. fib.sh
         
    This is a bash script that performes the computations of the Fibonacci sequence and provides output for fibonacci.php.  This script should be made executable to user desired. This will most likely be the functional user running the webserver. The scipt must also be placed in a location that is accessable to the webserver.
   
    EXAMPLE LOCATION: server:/webscripts/fib.sh


2. fibonacci.php
   
   This is the service to be hosted from the webserver.  It should be placed in the intended deploy directory for the webserver being used.
  
   EXAMPLE LOCATION: server:/Apache24/htdocs/fibonacci.php
  
   IMPORTANT!: The fibonacci.php will need to be edited to reflect the environment, including the command needed to execute the fib.sh script.
  
   EXAMPLE:
   2:fibonacci.php - $result = shell_exec('C:\cygwin64\bin\bash C:\cygwin64\home\Boscarino\scripts\fib.sh ' . $_GET['integer']);
           edit to - $result = shell_exec('/bin/bash /webscripts/fib.sh ' . $_GET['integer']);
                                                                       ^ --space required


USE:

   When successfully deployed, accessing the hosted page directly will provide the JSON formated message:
      'A single integer is required'

   If a supplied parameter of ?integer={n} is provided to the direct url, the page will provide the first {n} Fibonacci numbers, starting from zero.

   If a negative number is used for {n} of ?integer={n}, the page will provide the JSON formated message:
      'Integer may not be negative'
      
EXAMPLES:

      URL: localhost/fibonacci.php
   OUTPUT: A single integer is required

      URL: localhost/fibonacci.php?integer=-1
   OUTPUT: Integer may not be negative
   
      URL: localhost/fibonacci.php?integer=foobar
   OUTPUT: 

      URL: localhost/fibonacci.php?integer=5
   OUTPUT: 0 1 1 2 3


LIMITATIONS:

   32-bit = max ?integer={n} value 47
   64-bit = max ?integer={n} value 93
   
   Providing values that are larger than the maximum specified for the architectures listed above will cause integer overflow, resulting in output that does not represent calculations of the Fibonacci sequence.

OTHER NOTES:

     The fib.sh has been designed to accept a second parameter of function. If no function is given (default), the Fibonacci function will run.
